## Introduction:
A light theme with a nav style menu layout where the first drop down is done horizontally.  The message index is redone to have the avatar first, and move topic page navigation to a single area.  The board display has the infocenter as a right sidebar. The topic display has an updated poster area where some items that were normally hidden in the drop down have been exposed.  Has a slider quick login bar and a expanding search menu.
