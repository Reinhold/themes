## Introduction:
This is a light theme done in shades of grey and blue.  I have done a few things to make this more modern / minimal.  It uses few shadows, a tight radius, a more subdued color palette and a few other tweaks such as no side borders, etc.  A subtle change can be seen in the breadcrumb arrows which are done at a softer angle and taller block.  As you scroll the page, once the top menu reaches the page top, it turns into a fixed menu so that it is always accessible.
