## Introduction:
A light theme with shades of grey and blue.  The board index layout has changed for a cleaner look. The message index is redone to show the avatar first, and move topic page navigation to a single area.  The topic display has an updated poster area where some items that were normally hidden in the drop down have been exposed.  Has a slider quick login bar and a expanding search menu to snaz things up a bit.
