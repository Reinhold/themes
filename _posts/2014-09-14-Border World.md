## Introduction:
A light theme with a menu layout reminisent of some zen themes.  This still uses the standard superfish menu
js as the standard ElkArte theme but in nav style.  More squared corners than standard Elk.  Has a slider quick login
bar and a expanding search menu to snaz things up a bit.  The colors are based upon the Metro UI theme used in Windows 8.
